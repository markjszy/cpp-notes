# Notes

* Initialization v assignment
* Direct mappings to conventional hardware; performance 
* `const` and `constexpr` ; frequency of using const references as args to fcns
* Brace initialization v `=` operator -- `{}` benefits including no narrowing
* Use of `auto`
* Modern iteration over collections
* References v. pointers
